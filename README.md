# Pipelining is a technique used in modern processors to improve performance by executing multiple instructions simultaneously. It breaks down the execution of instructions into several stages, where each stage completes a part of the instruction. These stages can overlap, allowing the processor to work on different instructions at various stages of completion, similar to an assembly line in manufacturing. In a pipelined processor, a pipeline has two ends, the input end and the output end. Between these ends, there are multiple stages/segments such that the output of one stage is connected to the input of the next stage and each stage performs a specific operation.Interface registers are used to hold the intermediate output between two stages. These interface registers are also called latch or buffer. All the stages in the pipeline along with the interface registers are controlled by a common clock.Pipelining is one of the most essential concepts and it improves CPU’s capability to process several instructions at the same time across various stages. It increases immensely the system’s throughput and overall efficiency by effectively determining the optimum use of hardware. On its own it enhances the processing speed but handling of pipeline hazards is critical for enhancing efficiency. It is thus crucial for any architect developing systems that will support HPC to have a war chest of efficient pipelining strategies that they can implement.
